# cs-149
A comprehensive repository with works on linux kernel utility building and defining OS operations (Forking, Scheduling, Utilities, Memory Utilization, Memory Fragmentation, etc.)

The projects are small yet powerful linux utilities built to perform and handle specific OS taks

The projects were build while taking the CS-149 (Operating Systems) course, with Professor Ben Reed at San Jose State University
